# Perth Elixir Meetup

This repo will be used to collect any material from talks and can also be used to suggest a talk topic.

# Schedule

The Meetup will run on the third Wednesday of each month.

## Venue

ThoughtWorks are kindly hosting us at their Perth office.  This is located on [Level 3 at 40 St Georges Terrace, Perth](https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/40+St+Georges+Terrace,+Perth+WA+6000/@-31.9553955,115.8574155,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2a32bad6201dd6b1:0x2f7a9638ce9e9fb!8m2!3d-31.9553955!4d115.8596042).

# Code of Conduct

This CoC is adapted from [Elixir Code of Conduct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elixir-lang/elixir/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Why have a Code of Conduct?

As contributors and maintainers of the Meetup, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.

The goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about Elixir effectively, productively, and respectfully, even in face of disagreements. The Code of Conduct also provides a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.

## Our Values

These are the values Elixir developers should aspire to:

  * Be friendly and welcoming
  * Be patient
    * Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
  * Be thoughtful
    * Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
    * Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
  * Be respectful
    * In particular, respect differences of opinion. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
  * Avoid destructive behavior
    * Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
    * Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer (or at least solicit) suggestions as to how things may be improved.
    * Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).

The following actions are explicitly forbidden:

  * Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
  * Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
  * Bullying or systematic harassment.
  * Unwelcome sexual advances.
  * Incitement to any of these.

## Where does the Code of Conduct apply?

This CoC applies to the Meetup, group events and associated resources (such as Github repositories)

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting group organisers. All complaints will be dealt with promptly and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

**The goal of the Code of Conduct is to resolve conflicts in the most harmonious way possible**. We hope that in most cases issues may be resolved through polite discussion and mutual agreement. Bannings and other forceful measures are to be employed only as a last resort. **Do not** post about the issue publicly or try to rally sentiment against a particular individual or group.
