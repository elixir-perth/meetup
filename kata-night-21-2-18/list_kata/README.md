# ListKata

## Implement your own versions of the built in Enum functions.

In functional languages list operations like length, map, and reduce are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations, without using existing functions.

## Running tests

`mix test` will run the test suite.  Remove the `@tag :pending` to enable the next test as you progress.
